# UFOs
Practice and Challenge Assignment for Module 11

## Background
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Purpose
The webpage for UFO Sightings might be functional, but there are too many datapoints for the average netizen to scroll through. As a result, Dana asked to have a filter that can search for date, city, state, country, and the shape of the Unidentified Flying Object. The purpose of this project is to build the specified filter and to demonstrate that it is functional. 

## Results
The filters for the website work as demonstrated below:

* Date

![Date]()

* City

![City]()

* Country

* Shape
